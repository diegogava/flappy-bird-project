# flappy-bird-project
This project was made as a final challenge of a HTML, CSS, JS online course from Udemy, hosted by "cod3r.com".  
The challenge was basically to make a "flappy-bird sort of game", using raw HTML, CSS and JS. For this exercise, the teacher has shown his already made game behaviour, and gave us the hint to use flex-box for the game components. 
The game must work the following way: 
- The bird (represented as a yellow square) must fly trought the gaps between pipes placed on the top and bottom of the screen. 
- The pipes must have random sizes, but the gap between them must aways be the same.
- The bird must always fall, and fly right at a constant speed.
- The player can press a key to make the bird gain altitude.
- For each pair of pipes that the bird go trought without touching it, a point is added to the score. 
- If the bird touch any of the pipes, the game ends.
- The player can press a key to restart the game.
